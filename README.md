Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data
This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.
* Get the data ZIP file from this site  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Unzip the file to the ./data directory where the data files will be contained (e.g. C:\WorkSpace\RProject\Getting and Cleaning Data\data\UCI HAR Dataset)
* The run_analysis.R script should be located in the root folder (e.g. C:\WorkSpace\RProject\Getting and Cleaning Data)
* Execute command source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio
* You should see the following text output in the R Studio Console:
* [1] "Final Project Getting and Cleaning Data"
* [1] "Reading data files"
* [1] "1. Merging the training and test data sets to create one data set"
* [1] "2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard devication for each measurement"
* [1] "3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set"
* [1] "4. Labeling data set with descriptive variable names"
* [1] "5. creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
* A Tidy.txt file will be created in the data folder (e.g. C:\WorkSpace\RProject\Getting and Cleaning Data\data\UCI HAR Dataset) which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
